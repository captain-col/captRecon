The parameters that control the reconstruction.


The average drift velocity in the argon.

< captRecon.driftVelocity = 1.6 mm/us >

The maximum drift time in the TPC.  This is used to help find the time
zero.  

< captRecon.cluster3d.maxDrift = 1 m >

The maximum time between 2d clusters and still combine them into 3d
clusters.  This is in units of the RMS.  A value of 1.73 would mean that
clusters with a uniform charge distribution are combined if they overlap by
"half".  This can be set ridiculously large, but it makes the code slow.

< captRecon.cluster3d.xSeparation = 3.0 >
< captRecon.cluster3d.vSeparation = 3.0 >
< captRecon.cluster3d.uSeparation = 3.0 >

The fraction of the charge distribution that overlaps between wire hits

< captRecon.cluster3d.minimumOverlap = 0.5 >

The maximum time that a reconstructed 3D hit can cover.  This prevents them
from being long and skinny along the time axis (i.e. Z).  The horizontal (X
& Y) spread for the hit is limited by the wire spacing.

< captRecon.cluster3d.maximumSpread = 4 us >

The parameters for density clustering.  The minimum points is the number of
neighbors in the region, and maxDistance is the radius of the region.

< captRecon.densityCluster.minPoints = 2 >
< captRecon.densityCluster.maxDistance = 20 mm >

The parameters slicing the hits into first guess tracks. The minimum points
is the number of neighbors in the region, and maxDistance is the radius of
the region. 

< captRecon.clusterSlice.clusterExtent = 6 mm > 
< captRecon.clusterSlice.clusterGrowth = 10 > 
< captRecon.clusterSlice.clusterStep = 3 mm > 
< captRecon.clusterSlice.minHits = 2 > 
< captRecon.clusterSlice.minPoints = 1 >
< captRecon.clusterSlice.minStep = 0.75 mm >
< captRecon.clusterSlice.maxDistance = 5 mm >

Define the conversion between charge and energy.  The units are energy per
charge in eV/(collected electron).  This matches the ICARUS measurement of
29300 e- per MeV.  This is approximately the activation energy (~19.5 MeV)
corrected by the recombination probability (~43%)

< captRecon.energyPerCharge = 34.1 eV >
