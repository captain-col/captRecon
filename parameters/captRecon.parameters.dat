The parameters that control the reconstruction.


The average drift velocity in the argon.

< captRecon.driftVelocity = 1.6 mm/us >

The maximum drift time in the TPC.  This is used to help find the time
zero.  

< captRecon.cluster3d.maxDrift = 1 m >

The maximum time between 2d clusters and still combine them into 3d
clusters.  This is in units of the RMS.  A value of 1.73 would mean that
clusters with a uniform charge distribution are combined if they overlap by
"half".  This can be set ridiculously large, but it makes the code slow.

< captRecon.cluster3d.xSeparation = 3.0 >
< captRecon.cluster3d.vSeparation = 3.0 >
< captRecon.cluster3d.uSeparation = 3.0 >

The fraction of the charge distribution that overlaps between wire hits

< captRecon.cluster3d.minimumOverlap = 0.5 >

The maximum time that a reconstructed 3D hit can cover.  This prevents them
from being long and skinny along the time axis (i.e. Z).  The horizontal (X
& Y) spread for the hit is limited by the wire spacing.

< captRecon.cluster3d.maximumSpread = 4 us >

The parameters for density clustering.  The minimum points is the number of
neighbors in the region, and maxDistance is the radius of the region.

< captRecon.densityCluster.minPoints = 2 >
< captRecon.densityCluster.maxDistance = 20 mm >

The parameters slicing the hits into first guess tracks. The minimum points
is the number of neighbors in the region, and clusterExtent is the radius of
the region. 

< captRecon.clusterSlice.minHits = 2 > 
< captRecon.clusterSlice.minPoints = 1 >
< captRecon.clusterSlice.minStep = 0.75 mm >
< captRecon.clusterSlice.clusterStep = 3 mm > 
< captRecon.clusterSlice.clusterExtent = 7 mm > 
< captRecon.clusterSlice.clusterGrowth = 10 > 

Define the conversion between charge and energy.  The units are energy per
charge in eV/(collected electron).  This matches the ICARUS measurement of
29300 e- per MeV.  This is approximately the activation energy (~19.5 MeV)
corrected by the recombination probability (~43%)

< captRecon.energyPerCharge = 34.1 eV >

Define the parameters associated with combining objects that are
representing the same sets of hits.

< captRecon.combineOverlaps.overlap = 0.66 >

The parameter defining the mininum length for the reconstructed track. Tracks with smaller length will be destroyed. 

< captRecon.destroyShortTracks.minLength = 15 mm >

The parameters defining properties of the cluster for ClusteringUnusedHits which is 5 and 20 . They defining the minimum number of 3D hits in the cluster and the maximum spread of these hits for one cluster. 

< captRecon.clusterUnusedHits.minPoints = 5 >
< captRecon.clusterUnusedHits.maxDist = 20 mm >

TClustering 2D algotithm parameters

< captRecon.clustering2D.minPoints = 5 >
< captRecon.clustering2D.maxDist = 25 mm >

Parameter in THitTransfer to reject hits with charge less then this ammount. They are still get saved, but are not being used in reconstruction at all. As for now most of noise appeared in events is less then 4000, but I set this parameter for 0 now.

< captRecon.hitTransfer.minCharge = 15 >

Enable check for hits to have valid Charge/Time info

< captRecon.hitTransfer.validChargeTime = 0 >
