The parameters that control the reconstruction.


The average drift velocity in the argon.

< captRecon.driftVelocity = 1.6 mm/us >

The maximum drift time in the TPC.  This is used to help find the time
zero.  

< captRecon.cluster3d.maxDrift = 1 m >

The maximum time between 2d clusters and still combine them into 3d
clusters.  This is in units of the RMS.  A value of 1.73 would mean that
clusters with a uniform charge distribution are combined if they overlap by
"half" 

< captRecon.cluster3d.xSeparation = 1.73 >
< captRecon.cluster3d.vSeparation = 1.73 >
< captRecon.cluster3d.uSeparation = 1.73 >

The parameters for density clustering.  The minimum points is the number of
neighbors in the region, and maxDistance is the radius of the region.

< captRecon.densityCluster.minPoints = 2 >
< captRecon.densityCluster.maxDistance = 20 mm >

The parameters slicing the hits into first guess tracks. The minimum points
is the number of neighbors in the region, and maxDistance is the radius of
the region. 

< captRecon.clusterSlice.clusterStep = 3 mm > 
< captRecon.clusterSlice.minHits = 2 > 
< captRecon.clusterSlice.minPoints = 1 >
< captRecon.clusterSlice.minStep = 0.75 mm >
< captRecon.clusterSlice.maxDistance = 5 mm >
